run ./setup_ubuntu20p04_server.sh

That will get you everything for the vmware server version.
The only thing to you need to do to have this work is be running in vmware and have git as your folder name for your shared folder.

Note that the ./install_and_setup_texlive.sh portion takes a very long time (30
      minutes or so) so plan for that.
